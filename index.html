            <p>Basketball star James Harden, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, is known as much for his prominent beard as he is for his stellar play on the court. The No. 3 pick in the 2009 NBA draft, he began his career with the Oklahoma City Thunder before a stunning trade to the Houston Rockets in 2012. Harden has since emerged as a perennial MVP candidate and one of the top scorers in NBA history, ranking 25th all-time as of November 2023.</p>

                <h4>Thunder</h4>
                <p>Harden was Selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Harden got his pro career off to a strong start by earning All-Rookie Second Team honors.
                By 2011-12, he was an integral part of a team that also featured superstar scorers Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Harden was named the winner of the NBAs Sixth Man of the Year Award, and the Thunder rolled through the playoffs before suffering a tough five-game loss to LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.
                Capping his breakout season, Harden was a member of the gold-medal-winning U.S. Olympic team at the 2012 London Olympics..</p>

                <h4>Rockets</h4>
                <p>In late October 2012, shortly before the start of the NBA season, the Thunder sent ripples through the league with the announcement that they were trading Harden to the Houston Rockets, reportedly over the inability of the two sides to come to terms on a contract.
                In return, the Thunder received guard Kevin Martin, recent draft pick Jeremy Lamb, and multiple future draft picks, but the lack of an impact player to match the production of Harden resulted in the trade being viewed as heavily lopsided in favor of Houston.
                After joining the Rockets prior to the 2012-13 season, Harden emerged as one of the top players in the NBA. He earned the first of six straight All-Star berths that year and finished second in the voting for Most Valuable Player in 2015 and 2017 before finally claiming the trophy in 2018.</p>

                <h4>Sixers</h4>
                <p>Harden was an All-Star for the 10th consecutive year but was again the subject of trade rumors. In February 2022, Brooklyn traded the superstar to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for a package including draft picks as well as young point guard Ben Simmons. The Sixers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs with Harden for two years in a row.</p>

                <h4>Clippers</h4>
                <p>In June 2023, Harden exercised his player option with Philadelphia worth $35.6 million. However, he became vocal in his criticism of the team’s front office, calling Daryl Morey—now the Sixers’ president of basketball operations—a liar and requesting a trade. Harden missed media day and the opening day of training camp, then didn’t suit up in Philadelphia’s first three games in late October.In the early morning of October 31, ESPN reported that Philadelphia agreed to trade Harden to the Los Angeles Clippers for a package that included four players and multiple draft selections. The deal was finalized the next day.</p>
